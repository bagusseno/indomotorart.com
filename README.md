# indomotorart.com
Indomotorart is a gallery website which was developed using PHP native and MySQL. It has a lot of features, such as: Member Area, Image Upload, Email Verification, Social Media, Up Vote System, Comment System, Reputation System, Search System, Feed System, Specified-Feed System, etc.

## Note
Since it's not purposed for public, I didn't set up the entire files to be a "starter pack" so everyone can use it. It was already fulfilled with what I wanted.

## Features
### Member Area
Everyone can register an account in indomotorart.com. They will also get a user profile, including its unique URL. Inside a profile, there are user's posts, bio, reputation, join date, etc.

### E-mail Verification
Registered users have to verify their e-mail to prevent spams.

### Post and Comment System
Activated users can post images and comments.

### Up Vote System
Picture Posts have up vote system. Only activated users can vote posts. 

### New and Popular Post Feed
Since there is Up Vote System, a popular post feed feature can be created.

### Social Media System
Activated users can post a status that can be seen by everyone around the world. A status can be commented by other activated users. It also has independent link. Its comment system is a threaded comment so someone can reply a comment right under the comment. I also implemented tag system which is dynamic and interactable. When you post something with a tag, the system will automatically detect the tag and input it to the database.
